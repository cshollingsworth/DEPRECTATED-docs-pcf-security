##<a id='who'></a>For Security Professionals and PCF Users

This guide explains how Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) manages network access, roles and permissions, internal communications, container hardening, and other security issues. It is intended to give security professionals a complete view of PCF security, and to help all PCF users, not just the security experts, keep the platform secure.

In addition, this guide provides information about PCF compliance with published control standards and regulations such as [NIST Special Publication 800-53(r4)](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf) and [GPDR](https://eugdpr.org/).
